Ecommerce businesses must make decisions in real time about how to spend their advertising budgets to increase store revenue. In this project, I analyze an 8.39 GB csv file in "real-time" using a basic "Kafka" message broker produced by my project leader, Leon Staubach. As view and purchase events come in, I update our parameters based on the category of the item. I periodically display the output using a graph so that the owner of the store can see how much revenue each page view generates on average.

In a real use case, the next step would be to analyze average Cost of Goods Sold per purchase. While we don't have access to this data in the dataset, the owner of the store could easily access this data, so it is a natural next step. This update would let us determine profit per purchase instead of revenue only.

Another update we could make is automating ad purchasing decisions such as increasing our Google advertising bids when the revenue per view is higher. There are many use cases for this dashboard that cannot currently be automated, though, such as deciding which categories to write SEO content for or which categories to highlight in email marketing campaigns, making the visual display the currently preferred output.

One key assumption made in this analysis is that a paid view at the top of the funnel roughly translates to a view in this dataset. It is likely that the average viewer already on our website is more likely to make a purchase compared to the average random viewer advertised to on the internet, meaning we would be overspending on advertising. On the other hand, one visitor to the website will have multiple page views meaning that the top of the funnel page view may actually be more valuable than this analysis shows. One way to combat this would be to analyze user sessions instead of views, but our assumption leads to both an over and an underestimation which will hopefully cancel out somewhat. Furthermore, the ratios of our analysis will be the same, so given a fixed advertising budget and cost per page visit on an advertising service, we can still spend our advertising budget in an optimal way.

I want to give a huge thanks to my project leader, Leon Staubach, for his help in this project. Before this project, I had zero experience in real-time data analysis, and he was always extremely patient in helping me understand the next steps. He also had super fun topics to teach us every week like the importance of explainability in ML models or using sin/cos space for numerical features with cyclical proerties. I also want to thank Phillip Park and Regina Paek for their willingness to share their progress every week so that we could all learn from each other.
